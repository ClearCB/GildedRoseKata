At this file we will keep update the "behaviour" of each category existing in the GildedRose shop. 
Each product has a "name", a "sell-in" date and a "quality" that describe each product.

First we will introduce each type of product they offer:

- Normal Items
- Aged Brie
- Backstage
- Sulfuras

Last introduction:

- Conjured

The problem is that the quality update behaviour of each product is diferent, so we will make a list
on how it works.

Common
------

All the items at the shop, has a common constraint about the quality:

The quality is always greater or equal than 0 and lower than 50.

------------
Normal Items
------------

The quality of Normal Items degrade 1 per day passed till the sell-in date arrives. Once this date arrives
the quality starts degrading twice fast as normal.

---------
Aged Brie
---------

The quality of Aged Brie items increases the quality in a reverse ways than the NormalItem does.

The longer the sell_in date is close, the more quality the item gets

Increases 1 till the sell-in date arrives, and then it start upgrading its quality per 2. 

------------------------
Sulfuras, legendary item
------------------------

The sulfuras item is a little bit special, since it is legendary...it wont even be sold and 
its quality will never be diferent than 80.

---------
Backstage
---------

The backstage item quality update will depend on the sell in date.

If the sell in date is 10 or less, the quality will increase
